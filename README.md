# Iris Biometric Recognition - In progress
In this project, I am going to replicate my undergraduate thesis. You can find the paper from that investigation in this [link](https://revistas.utp.edu.co/index.php/revistaciencia/article/view/22861/16382). You can also download the database used for that project in the following [link](https://academia.utp.edu.co/jacoper/biometrics/), the same database that I am going to use for this project.
